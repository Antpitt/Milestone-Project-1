Milestone Project 1

Hello my name is Anthony Pittman, I am creating a Connect 4. My inspiration for making this game is board games that I play with my family. I was always playing connect 4 growing up and even now I still play it from time to time. Creating Connect 4 itself can be complicated but this is a 2 player game that will be able to determine a winner, loser, and tie. 

Similar functions were used throughotu my code from a code creator of the same game. The creators name is Kenny Yip and this github repository reflects similar functions used throughout the code. https://github.com/ImKennyYip/Connect4/tree/master.
