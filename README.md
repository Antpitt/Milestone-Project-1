Milestone Project 1

Hello my name is Anthony Pittman, I am creating a Connect 4. My inspiration for making this game is board games that I play with my family. I was always playing connect 4 growing up and even now I still play it from time to time. Creating Connect 4 itself can be complicated but this is a 2 player game that will be able to determine a winner, loser, and tie. 

Similar functions were used throughotu my code from a code creator of the same game. The creators name is Kenny Yip and this github repository reflects similar functions used throughout the code. https://github.com/ImKennyYip/Connect4/tree/master. 

A bug throughout the code would be the reset board functio. Haven't gotten the function to work to remove all the pieces and text that displays when a winner is declared. 

Connect 4 is played by two people that go back and fourth with placing either their red or yellow piece on the board. While placing your pieces throughout the board the goal is to make a straight line of 4 of your pieces. Once a player has done that they have won the game. 

There was mainly id and classes to make all the styling throughout the html and css. Also in javascript for loops and callback functions were used to execute.
